\ Interacting with the UART on QEMU's VersatilePB
\ UART0 (connected by QEMU to stdin/out) is at 0x101f1000.
\ - UARTDR, the read and write data register, is cell-sized and at offset 0.
\ I don't think any configuration is really required on QEMU, they just fake the
\ operation; it should Just Work.
